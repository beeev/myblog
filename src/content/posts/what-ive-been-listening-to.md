These two albums have been on repeat lately:  

![Ghosted III](/images/ghosted.jpg)

**Ghosted III** by Oren Ambarchi, Johan Berthling and Andreas Werliin — spacey, moody ambient jazz with gorgeous bass tones.  

![Different Rooms](/images/different-rooms.jpg)

**Different Rooms** by Jeremiah Chiu and Marta Sofia Honer — lighter, brighter, and the perfect soundtrack to the end of summer.
