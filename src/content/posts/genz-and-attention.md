I have to politely disagree with this tweet. Remember when Microsoft claimed that [Millennials had an 8 second attention span](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/opinion/the-eight-second-attention-span.html)? 


As for wrapping it in marketing speak, and calling it a consideration span is also unfair. [Karen Nelson-Field](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://au.linkedin.com/in/karen-nelson-field-phd-a4b5b519&ved=2ahUKEwj89ae_mt-PAxXXGhAIHV0tGhQQFnoECDEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1fd8g2W_zcSdDEWUgtlLJu) has done a great deal of work on this area, and her book The Attention Economy lays out the facts. On a recent podcast, [Byron Sharp claimed attention was "solved](https://podcasts.apple.com/se/podcast/call-to-action/id1451970867?l=en-GB&i=1000722057008)". 


To summarise her research:


**Most ads are barely noticed**

- Around half of ads are only *half-seen* for a second or two
- People scroll/flick fast, multi task and process ads with low attention

**Attention Drives Sales**

- Ads that capture and hold attention for longer will deliver a sales uplift
- An extra few seconds of genuine attention can make a big difference

**Not all attention is equal**

- High Attention (actively watching) is rare
- Low/Pre attention (glancing, subconscious) is common, and still useful for building memory if the branding is super clear

**Creative must earn attention**

- Surprise people by boldly breaking or subverting their expectations
- Use emotion to spark interest
- Make the brand big, clear and early (otherwise attention is wasted)



The key part that you need to take away: *subvert expectations.*
